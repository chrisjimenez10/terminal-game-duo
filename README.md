# Terminal Game based on Castle Battle
## By Chris Jimenez and Umang Diwan

1. Introduction to the game

- We created a banner style introduction to the name of the game just to make it easy on the eyes.
- Within the introduction we included the instructions to the game and some lore behind the story.
- For the instructions and the lore we decided to give the players the option to decide whether they want to read the instructions or the lore.

### Bugs

- While creating the introduction which gives players the option to read the instructions or the lore, we forgot to add the while loop which prevents random inputs to progress the code.
